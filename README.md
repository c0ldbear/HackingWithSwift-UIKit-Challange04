## Instructions
Details of the challange can be found here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/5/3/challenge
But in large, the app is supposed to be able to use the camera so that the user can photograph things they want to save and add a caption to it. At this time the data is saved to UserDefaults.

As a step towards in this challange (and stopped at) the user can load images from the photo library. The task of using the camera directly in the app is still to be done, since I do not own a USB-A to Lightning cable and therefore it is not possible to load the app to my phone :(
